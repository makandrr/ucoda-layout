Setting goals? Bah! Theorems, not dreams, drive progress. Yet, like optimizing an algorithm, motivation fuels the fire. This "goal-setting course" offered a curious heuristic: clear objectives coupled with incremental rewards. Intriguing. I tested it on The Art of Computer Programming – surprisingly effective! Though I scoff at "intrinsic drive," perhaps a well-placed carrot can grease the wheels of even the most rigorous pursuit. Verdict: intriguing tool, not a panacea. Now, back to TeX – optimization awaits!
